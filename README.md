Wish Chain is an interactive online experience in which users catch dandelion seeds in midair and contribute to a growing chain of wishes. These wishes are stored in an online database and can be read by anyone. My goal was to try to facilitate a sense of connection among visitors to the site as they make wishes and see the links between their own and those of others.
